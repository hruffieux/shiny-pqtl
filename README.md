## Shiny app for an online QTL database of protein abundance in plasma

The database is accessible [here](https://locus-pqtl.epfl.ch/db/) and accompanies the paper:

H. Ruffieux, J. Carayol, R. Popescu, M. E. Harper, R. Dent, W. H. M. Saris, A. Astrup, A. C. Davison, J. Hager, and A. Valsesia. A fully joint Bayesian quantitative trait locus mapping of human protein abundance in plasma, PLOS Computational Biology, 16:e1007882, 2020.

Note that the univariate analysis summary statistics of our study are now also listed in the GWAS Catalog [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/search?query=32492067).
